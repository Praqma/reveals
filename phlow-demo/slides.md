## As a developer


**I want**<br> 
Features that support the process that makes development easier

**So that**<br> 
I don't have to go to many different tools, to organize and manage my work flow

I don't have to wait for manual processes

## As a product owner

**I want**<br> every single commit to happen for a documented reason, and that reason should be tied to the the commit

**So that**<br> When I need an overview I can just browse the commit history
