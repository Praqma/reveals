#Why TDD?

 * Fast feedback loop
 * Simpler code
 * Confidence in the code

>>>>NEWSLIDE

> "George and Williams [12] later conducted a formal TDD experiment with professional pair programmers. They reported that the TDD pairs' product quality was on average 18 percent higher than that of the non-TDD pairs, while their productivity was 14 percent lower."

#Practice

When was the last time you wrote some code that wasn't tied to a deadline?

>>>>NEWSLIDE

# Deliberate Practice

When was the last time you practiced writing code together, as a team?

>>>>NEWSLIDE

# Deliberate practice

 * Do not practice in your normal development environment
 * Do not practice alone
 * Learn to go slow
 * Do short timed iterations, reflect, and then start again from scratch.
 * Focus on improvement, not on completion, not on perfection.
