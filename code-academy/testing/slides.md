# Why are we testing

- Mitigate risk
- Increase speed
- Document functionality

# Test it all!
Not really, too expensive

# The testing iceberg

>>>>NEWSLIDE
# Impact vs likelihood

- how likely is it that a faliure will occour?
- And how severe is it when the faliure occours?

# Types of tests

- unit tests
- functional tests
- performance test
- integration test
- security test
- regression test

>>>>NEWSLIDE
# Small focus
We are only focusing on unit tests and functional tests here.
Gonna use that later in the process.
//Insert CoDe Storyline to talk about where the two tests goes in.

>>>>NEWSLIDE
# Unit tests

- Fast
- Small
- Made by the developer
- Used in the verification step of our process
- "does my function behave like I want it to?"

>>>>NEWSLIDE
# Functional tests

- Longer running tests
- end to end verification
- API
- "Is the feature of my program correct?"

# Some test without code: write the code 
//We need a function that does a specific thing, and where are tests implemented to validate the designed implementation.
//very simple
